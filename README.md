# Ultrasonic Sensor Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how we would implement a system where cars could communicate using the ultrasonic systems built into them. In our system they would be able to share short signals to each other, such as if they plan to merge, change lanes, slow down, etc.

The project is broken up into two parts, the tranmitter (which would generate and transmit the signal) and the receiver (which would receive the signal and be mindful of dopler shifts, etc). Currently the project is written in three languages for ease of testing, however for the final API it will all be written in the same language, likely python or C.
